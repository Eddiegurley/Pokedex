 I created a pokedex. It has three distinct features: 1. It will fetch 150 pokemon at a time wth the name, image, and type on cards. 2. It also has a search input that allows you to type the name of any pokemon and it will display the pokemon. 3. it also has a previous page button and a next page button so you can scroll through the complete library.
